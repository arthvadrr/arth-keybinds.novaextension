# Arth's Keybinds

Custom keybinds for my personal setup. This extension will conflict with many default keybindings and is not intended for other users at this point.

I plan on expanding functionality soon.

## Roadmap

- Enable users to access keybindings for "text" commands through the keybindings menu.
- Increase the variety of methods and commands users can customize for keybinding.
- Implement a command to switch the text commands on and off conveniently.
- Ensure that the new keybindings minimize conflicts with existing default keybindings.
- Update the readme file to provide clear instructions on how users can understand and utilize these new keybindings effectively.
